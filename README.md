# AutoDeafen-Plus

AutoDeafen+ is a geometry dash mod extension to the Auto Deafen mod in Megahack v7. This mod is in alpha so many QOL features aren't available yet, but will soon, like selecting keybinds etc.

It allows you to create "Auto Deafen Presets" for levels, so you don't have to change your auto deafen every time you play a new level, as it will switch automatically when you play it. These also work for start positions, so auto deafen with startpos is now much easier as it is pre-set!

INSTALLATION:

- Select "Code" at the top of the repository, and click Download Zip.
- Extract files in the .zip downloaded

# For steps below, files are located in the AutoDeafen+ folder in your extracted files.

- Drag all descendants in the Resources folder to your Resources folder in geometry dash local files
- Drag AutoDeafen+.dll into the Extensions folder in your geometry dash local files.
- Add a new deafen keybind on discord set to Right Shift + F7. (Don't worry, you can set multiple deafen keybinds so your normal one won't be affected.)
- Create keybinds by the icon in the bottom left on pause screens!
- Toggle the mod in the megahack menu, in the window labeled "AutoDeafen+".

Enjoy!
