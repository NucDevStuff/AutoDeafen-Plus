# AutoDeafen-Plus

AutoDeafen+ is a geometry dash mod extension to the Auto Deafen mod in Megahack v8, now in geode! (Custom keybind will soon be enable thanks to geode)

It allows you to create "Auto Deafen Presets" for levels, so you don't have to change your auto deafen every time you play a new level, as it will switch automatically when you play it. These also work for start positions, so auto deafen with startpos is now much easier as it is pre-set!

INSTALLATION:

- Download the .geode file in the latest release.
- Put the .geode file into your Geode mods folder. This is in your local files, inside the Geode folder, and then inside Mods.
- Add a new deafen keybind on discord set to Right Shift + F7. (Don't worry, you can set multiple deafen keybinds so your normal one won't be affected.)
- Create presets by the icon in the bottom left on pause screens!
- Toggle the mod in the Geode mod menu

Enjoy!
